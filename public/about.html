<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm santhosh, I’m a passionate and curious Robotics and Automation engineering student, currently on a journey to master Full-Stack Development.
   I love building things that solve real-world problems — whether it's through code or hardware.</p>

<p>Over time, I've developed a strong interest in website development and robotics. 
  Right now, I’m focused on becoming a skilled full-stack developer, with plans to combine that 
  with my core robotics knowledge to create innovative tech solutions.
</p>

<p>Apart from tech, I enjoy gaming, learning new things, and spending quality time with people who matter.</p>
